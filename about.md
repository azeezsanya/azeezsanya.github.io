Having worked across different cultures for 10+ years, helping organizations to develop their business, supporting the marketing department and incorporating different approaches to improve their customer service, I have seen the impact of data analysis in helping firms to make effective business decisions. I'm currently studying Data Science at BrainStation where I've been exposed to modern tools and techniques using Python, SQL and R to build predictive models, descriptive and diagnostic analysis, Data Mining, Machine Learning as well as Data Visualization to derive insight that will help organizations make impactful decisions.
